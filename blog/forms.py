from django import forms

'''
PostForm, as you probably suspect, is the name of our form. We need to tell Django that this form is a ModelForm (so Django will do some magic for us) â€“ forms.ModelForm is responsible for that.

Next, we have class Meta, where we tell Django which model should be used to create this form (model = Post).
Finally, we can say which field(s) should end up in our form.

class PostForm(forms.ModelForm):

    class Meta:
        model = Post
        fields = ('title', 'text')
